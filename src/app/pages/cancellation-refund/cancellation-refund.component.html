      <h2>Trial Period & Data Export Policy</h2>
      <p>
        At the end of the 6-month trial period, access to data export functionality will be
        restricted. Customers will not be allowed to export their data unless they subscribe to a
        paid plan.

        To enable data export, customers must subscribe to at least a one-month paid plan. Once the
        subscription is active, permission to export data will be granted according to the selected
        plan.
